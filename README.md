# metafacture-tutorial

This project is an idea but I have not started yet.

This is a selective copy of the catmandu tutorial (https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/day-1-getting-catmandu/) but adapted for Metafacture.
The Catmandu tutorial was created by @phochste. It is great if you want to learn Catmandu. So try it out.

Since Metafacture FIX is introducing a catmandu-fix like transformation language the addaption of the Catmandu Tutorial for Metafacture purposes seem to me obvioous.

It should help you to get accostumed with Metafacture Core and Metafacture Fix (sorry, no Metafacture Morph).

Have fun.
