## Day 1: Getting Catmandu

Metafacture is a data processing toolkit maintained by hbz and initially developed by DNB. 
Metafacture is a toolkit for processing semi-structured data with a focus on library metadata. 
It provides a versatile set of tools for reading, writing and transforming data - espacially library related metadata. 
Metafacture can be used as a stand-alone application or as a Java library in other applications.
The name Metafacture is a portmanteau of the words metadata and manufacture.

In this tutorial we are going to teach you how to use the command line tools of Metafacture to preform simple and advanced data processing tasks.

To be able to follow our examples you need to have access to a UNIX account with Catmandu installed.
If you are already familiar with the command line follow the installation guide here:

For first steps you could also use the [Metafacture Playground](https://metafacture.org/playground/). The playground it a webinterface that should help you getting started, test and share flux worflows.
